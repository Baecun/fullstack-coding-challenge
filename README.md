# [DRAFT]Â Unbabel Fullstack Challenge

Hey :smile:

Welcome to our Fullstack Challenge repository. This README will guide you on how to participate in this challenge.

In case you are doing this to apply for our open positions for a Fullstack Developer make sure you first check the available jobs at [https://unbabel.com/jobs](https://unbabel.com/jobs)

**FYI:** Please understand that this challenge is not decisive if you are applying to work at [Unbabel](https://unbabel.com/jobs). There are no right and wrong answers. This is just an opportunity for us both to work together and get to know each other in a more technical way.

#### What we value

##### Stack

Most of our integrations rely on MongoDB, Python (Flask/Django), Bootstrap3

We are great aficionados of python so most of our tools are build on top of Django and Flask.  
Don't feel the need to develop just in that . 
If you don't know it's okay. 
But we prefer this ones.



0. Fork this repository into your github account.






Final note: If there's anything you don't understand or is ambiguous, open an issue in this repository with the question.

0. Read the [list](problems/) and choose a problem to solve
0. You'll be given a link to a private repository which you can clone and work
   on to submit your challenge.
0. Open an Issue in your new repo with the problem you've chosen. You can use this
   issue to discuss the problem at hand or for asking questions.
0. Solve the problem any way you like, but do the best you can and try to take
   into consideration some of our [development practices](docs/development_practices.md).
   This means you can use any language, tools, libraries, etc. you need to get the job
   done with (although please don't choose something too esoteric as we need to be
   able to understand the great work you'll do :smiley: - the languages our team is familiar with are: Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C#, C, C++, PHP, Python, Node, Elixir and Scala - if you want to do it in a different language, please check with us first).
0. As is mentioned in the [development practices](docs/development_practices.md), you should be doing the development of this in a topic branch. Once you have something in your branch, you can open a Pull Request (to your own master branch) any time you like. You can use this pull request to discuss something code specific, or if you'd like some feedback on your code.
0. Once you have something more substantial to show, make sure you have a pull request open so that a code review can be performed within it.
0. Have fun!

*Note*: The git branches [backend-basic-setup][1] / [frontend-basic-setup][2]
contain a basic project setup that you can use if you like with the technologies
we routinely use at Talkdesk.

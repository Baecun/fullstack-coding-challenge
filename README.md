# Unbabel Fullstack Challenge

Hey :smile:

Welcome to our Fullstack Challenge repository. This README will guide you on how to participate in this challenge.

In case you are doing this to apply for our open positions for a Fullstack Developer make sure you first check the available jobs at [https://unbabel.com/jobs](https://unbabel.com/jobs)

**FYI:** Please understand that this challenge is not decisive if you are applying to work at [Unbabel](https://unbabel.com/jobs). There are no right and wrong answers. This is just an opportunity for us both to work together and get to know each other in a more technical way.
